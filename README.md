# MySQL Employee Tracker
Bootcamp Homework #12

## Description 
I have created a command line application that allows uses to interact any several ways with their employee database. Users can create a list of all departments, all roles, and all employes. It allows them to add a new department, role, or employee. Additionally, users can update an employee's role using the application. 

## Installation
This application requires Node and users should run "npm install" in their command line prior to use. In addition, use the schema.sql file to build your initial database prior to using the command line tool.
